# CeaSolver
1. This was one of my first programs and tools I wrote in bash. It was used to help automate the process of deciphering Ceaser Cipher or Rotation Cipher. 
2. This tool is far from perfect. I plan to make this code much smaller because in the code I repeat my self many times and
that could be easily fixed with a for loop.
