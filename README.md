# CeaSolver
1. This was one of my first programs written in bash. It was to help me when I came across Ceaser Ciphers or ROT Ciphers.
2. This tool is far from perfect. I plan to make this code much smaller because in the code I repeat my self many times and
that could be easily fixed with a for loop.
